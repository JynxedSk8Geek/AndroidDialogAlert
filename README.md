Android dialog alert
============

This library is meant for ease of implementation. Although some customization is provided. 

## Getting started

To get the best possible results (with some updates over time) I recommend the installation using cocoa pods:

`pod 'AndroidDialogAlert'`

Also, you can download the project and installed it manually.
All required files are inside `Pod/Classes`, just copy and paste them.

## Example

Add example...

## TODO's

- [ ] add show and dismiss custom animations

## Requirements:

- CocoaPods 1.0.0+
