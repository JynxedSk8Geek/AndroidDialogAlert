Android dialog alert
============

This library is meant for ease of implementation. Although some customization is provided. 

## Getting started

To get the best possible results (with some updates over time) I recommend the installation using cocoa pods:

`pod 'AndroidDialogAlert'`

Also, you can download the project and installed it manually.
All required files are inside `Pod/Classes`, just copy and paste them.

## Example

Add example...

## TODO's

- [ ] add show and dismiss custom animations


## Best practices

The command `pod lib create` aims to be ran along with this guide: http://guides.cocoapods.org/making/using-pod-lib-create.html so any changes of flow should be updated there also.

It is open to communal input, but adding new features, or new ideas are probably better off being discussed in an issue first. In general we try to think if an average Xcode user is going to use this feature or not, if it's unlikely is it a _very strongly_ encouraged best practice ( ala testing / CI. ) If it's something useful for saving a few minutes every deploy, or isn't easily documented in the guide it is likely to be denied in order to keep this project as simple as possible.

## Requirements:

- CocoaPods 1.0.0+
- iOS 9+
